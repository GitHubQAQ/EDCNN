## [Efficient In-loop Filtering Based on Enhanced Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for HEVC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9049421)

â€‹	We propose an efficient in-loop filtering algorithm based on the enhanced deep convolutional neural networks (EDCNN) for significantly improving the performance of in-loop filtering in HEVC. Based on the statistical analyses, the EDCNN is proposed for efficiently eliminating the artifacts, which adopts three solutions, including **a weighted normalization method**, **a feature information fusion block**, and **a precise loss function**.
